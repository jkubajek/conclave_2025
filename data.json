He is firmly opposed to the ordination of female deacons, blessing same-sex couples, making priestly celibacy optional, reassessing Humanae Vitae, and Communion for the divorced and remarried. He is a leading critic of the German Synodal Way and supports traditional liturgical practices. While committed to ecumenical and interreligious dialogue, he insists on doctrinal boundaries.",
        "Pastoral Score": 6,
        "Pastoral Summary": "Cardinal Rainer Woelki is a strong proponent of Catholic social teaching on economic justice and is outspoken in his support for migrants, refugees, and environmental responsibility. However, he is a vocal critic of the German Synodal Path and synodal reform efforts that he perceives as threatening Church unity and doctrine. His approach to new pastoral movements is more focused on structural reform and missionary orientation than on specific movements. Overall, he combines social advocacy with a conservative stance on Church governance and doctrine.",

His public communications and pastoral letters emphasize the opportunity for parishes and dioceses to engage in synodal dialogue and discernment, reflecting Pope Francis’s call for a synodal Church.

He called it naive to think the Pope would decide quickly on ordaining female deacons, indicating openness but not direct advocacy for change.",
